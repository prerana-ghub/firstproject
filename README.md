# 🌐 VIZON – Cybersecurity Awareness & Recruitment Website

VIZON is a fictional multi-page website designed to spread awareness about cybersecurity, explain common threats, and simulate a basic recruitment workflow.

## 📄 Project Structure

The project consists of 4 simple HTML files:

```
vizon/
├── 1.html           # Homepage – Cybersecurity overview
├── 2.html           # Recruitment process
├── 3.html           # Sign-up form
├── 4.html           # Application confirmation
└── README.md
```

Each page is linked using buttons for smooth user navigation from education to application.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project in VS Code

1. **Open the folder in Visual Studio Code**

   - Place all `.html` files in the same folder (e.g., `vizon`).
   - Open this folder in VS Code.

2. **Use the Live Server extension (optional but recommended)**

   If you don’t have it installed yet:
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for: `Live Server`
   - Install it

3. **Launch the site**

   - Right-click `1.html` → **Open with Live Server**
   - This will open the homepage in your default browser.
   - Use the buttons to navigate to `2.html`, `3.html`, and `4.html`.
